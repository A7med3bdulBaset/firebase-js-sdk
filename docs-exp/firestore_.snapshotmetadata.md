```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [fromCache](./firestore_.snapshotmetadata.md#snapshotmetadatafromcache-property) |  | boolean | True if the snapshot was created from cached data rather than guaranteed up-to-date server data. If your listener has opted into metadata updates (via <code>SnapshotListenOptions</code>) you will receive another snapshot with <code>fromCache</code> set to false once the client has received up-to-date data from the backend. |
|  [hasPendingWrites](./firestore_.snapshotmetadata.md#snapshotmetadatahaspendingwrites-property) |  | boolean | True if the snapshot contains the result of local writes (for example <code>set()</code> or <code>update()</code> calls) that have not yet been committed to the backend. If your listener has opted into metadata updates (via <code>SnapshotListenOptions</code>) you will receive another snapshot with <code>hasPendingWrites</code> equal to false once the writes have been committed to the backend. |

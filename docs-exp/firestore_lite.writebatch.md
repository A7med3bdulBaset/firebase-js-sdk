## WriteBatch class

A write batch, used to perform multiple writes as a single atomic unit.

A `WriteBatch` object can be acquired by calling [writeBatch()](./firestore_.md#writebatch_function)<!-- -->. It provides methods for adding writes to the write batch. None of the writes will be committed (or visible locally) until  is called.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class WriteBatch 
```

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [commit()](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatchcommit_method) |  | Commits all of the writes in this write batch as a single atomic unit.<!-- -->The result of these writes will only be reflected in document reads that occur after the returned Promise resolves. If the client is offline, the write fails. If you would like to see local modifications or buffer writes until the client is online, use the full Firestore SDK. |
|  [delete(documentRef)](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatchdelete_method) |  | Deletes the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. |
|  [set(documentRef, data)](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatchset_method) |  | Writes to the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. If the document does not exist yet, it will be created. |
|  [set(documentRef, data, options)](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatchset_method) |  | Writes to the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. If the document does not exist yet, it will be created. If you provide <code>merge</code> or <code>mergeFields</code>, the provided data can be merged into an existing document. |
|  [update(documentRef, data)](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatchupdate_method) |  | Updates fields in the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. The update will fail if applied to a document that does not exist. |
|  [update(documentRef, field, value, moreFieldsAndValues)](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatchupdate_method) |  | Updates fields in the document referred to by this [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. The update will fail if applied to a document that does not exist.<!-- -->Nested fields can be update by providing dot-separated field path strings or by providing <code>FieldPath</code> objects. |

## WriteBatch.commit() method

Commits all of the writes in this write batch as a single atomic unit.

The result of these writes will only be reflected in document reads that occur after the returned Promise resolves. If the client is offline, the write fails. If you would like to see local modifications or buffer writes until the client is online, use the full Firestore SDK.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
commit(): Promise<void>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

A Promise resolved once all of the writes in the batch have been successfully written to the backend as an atomic unit (note that it won't resolve while you're offline).

## WriteBatch.delete() method

Deletes the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
delete(documentRef: DocumentReference<unknown>): WriteBatch;
```

## Parameters

<b>Returns:</b>

[WriteBatch](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatch_class)

This `WriteBatch` instance. Used for chaining method calls.

## WriteBatch.set() method

Writes to the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. If the document does not exist yet, it will be created.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
set<T>(documentRef: DocumentReference<T>, data: T): WriteBatch;
```

## WriteBatch.set() method

Writes to the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. If the document does not exist yet, it will be created. If you provide `merge` or `mergeFields`<!-- -->, the provided data can be merged into an existing document.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
set<T>(documentRef: DocumentReference<T>, data: Partial<T>, options: SetOptions): WriteBatch;
```

<b>Returns:</b>

[WriteBatch](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatch_class)

This `WriteBatch` instance. Used for chaining method calls.

## WriteBatch.update() method

Updates fields in the document referred to by the provided [DocumentReference](./firestore_.documentreference.md#documentreference_class)<!-- -->. The update will fail if applied to a document that does not exist.

<b>Signature:</b>
